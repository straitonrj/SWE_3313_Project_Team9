# *UCars* Style Guide

This document serves as the definiton for the coding standards of *UCars*. In order to create and maintain a program of high quality, 
developers will conform to the following guidelines to produce consitently across the project. 

## Naming

- Variable names will follow UpperCamelCase, meaning that if the name must consist of multiple words, the words will be joined
together and the first letter of each word will be capitalized.  
- Method names will also follow UpperCamelCase, with the exception of getters and setters which will begin with lowercase letters.
    - Ex: getUserName(), setPassword()

## Whitespace

- A single blank line will seperate blocks of code which are grouped together.
- Blank lines may also appear anywhere which might improve the legibility of the code.

## Braces

- Braces are to be used with if, else, for, do, and while statements, even if there is no code in the body.
- Open and close braces must line up to better readability, especially in the case of classes or nested statements.
- Open brackets will not take up an entire line, they will be placed at the end of the previous line of code.

## Comments

- A comment should be added above complex methods to give a brief explanation of what it does.
- Long comments will begin with /* and end with */. The stars must line up.
- If a developer finds themselves at a roadblock during implementation, the developer should leave a comment explaining the situtation.
This way, another developer can find where the issue is and work to solve it. 

## File Naming
