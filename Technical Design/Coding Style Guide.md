# *UCars* Style Guide

This document serves as the definiton for the coding standards of *UCars*. In order to create and maintain a program of high quality, 
developers will conform to the following guidelines to produce consitently across the project. 

## Naming

- Variable names will follow UpperCamelCase, meaning that if the name must consist of multiple words, the words will be joined
together and the first letter of each word will be capitalized.  
- Method names will also follow UpperCamelCase, with the exception of getters and setters which will begin with lowercase letters.
    - Ex: getUserName(), setPassword()

## Whitespace

- A single blank line will seperate blocks of code which are grouped together.
- Blank lines may also appear anywhere mich might improve the legibility of the code.

## Braces

- Braces are to be used with if, else, for, do, and while statements, even if there is no code in the body.
- Open and close braces must line up to better readability, especially in the case of classes or nested statements.
