# Implementation Documentation

## Implementation Laungage
- Our team is using Java to implement the code for the Ucars application.
- The current team members are most comfortable with Java due to past experieces, thus it reduces the risk on the project to code in Java.
- Here are some tools to help new members learn Java:
  - [W3 Schools' Java Tutorial]

## Implementation Framework
- Our team is using the Swing framework for the Ucars application. 
- With JavaFX and Swing being the only options our team could come up with, we chose Swing.
- Our team chose Swing due to multiple factors:
  - JavaFX is slowly being replaced by newer technology 
  - JavaFX is harder to make visually pleasing
  - Swing is newer and more valuble to the team members learning it
- Current team members have no experience with either JavaFX or Swing, so there is not a large diffrence in risk when choosing Swing over JavaFX
-  Here are some tools to help new members learn Swing:

## Data Storage Plan
- A single blank line will seperate blocks of code which are grouped together.
- Blank lines may also appear anywhere which might improve the legibility of the code.
