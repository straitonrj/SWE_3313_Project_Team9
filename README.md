# SWE_3313_UCars

Welcome to the project repository for *UCars*. Here you will find all of the artifacts, presentations, documentation, and source code for our SWE 3313 Project.
We will create a desktop application that allows customers to buy used cars. This project will be written in Java using the Swing framework and SQL will be used as well.
