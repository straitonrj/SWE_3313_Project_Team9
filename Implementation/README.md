# Implementation

Here you will find all relevant work for the Implementation section of our *UCars* project. To aide our client in understanding how to set up the *UCars* software,
we have left an explanation for the general process of running the program.
## How to setup *UCars*
*UCars* is able to run all on systems that have the most recent update for the IntelliJ IDE. To run our software, please follow the following instructions:
  - Download the complete project file from this README.
  - Run IntelliJ and open the project file from the top left corner of IntelliJ.
  - Once the file is opened, navigate to the Main.java file under the src/main folder and the java/org/UCars folder underneath that.
  - Click the green button that says "run" while the Main.java file is opened and the program will execute.
