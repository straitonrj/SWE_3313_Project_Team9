# Implementation

Here you will find all relevant work for the Implementation section of our *UCars* project. To aide our client in understanding how to set up the *UCars* software,
we have left an explanation for the general process of running the program.

## What is *UCars*?
*UCars* is a user-oriented shopping application that will allow for new and existing users to browse and shop for the perfect car for them. Users are
able to sign up, login, browse available inventory, and purchase a car. Admins are able to promote other users to admin, add new cars to the database, and
view a comprehensive sales report. 

## How to setup *UCars*
*UCars* is able to run all on systems that have the most recent update for the IntelliJ IDE. To run our software, please follow the following instructions:
  - Download the complete project file from this README.
  - Run IntelliJ and open the project file from the top left corner of IntelliJ.
  - Once the file is opened, navigate to the Main.java file under the src/main folder and the java/org/UCars folder underneath that.
  - Click the green button that says "run" while the Main.java file is opened and the program will execute.
