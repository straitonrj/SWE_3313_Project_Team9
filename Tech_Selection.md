# Technology Plan for UCars

UCars is a desktop application that will allow customers to find and buy the perfect used car for them.

- **Written in Java**
- **Swing used for the UI framework**
- **JSON storage**
- **IntelliJ IDE**


# Why?

We as a group thought that it would be relatively easy to design an application that would sell used cars because 
it would be easy to keep track of different types of cars and their features. UCars will be programmed in Java because
that is what we all are the most familiar with, and we want to make sure we do it right. Due to the fact that our group is 
now a duo, we will be sticking to IntelliJ because it is what we are most familiar with. Learning new skills and technologies
is an absolute necessity in this industry, and as such we have selected Swing for the UI framework and JSON for the storage 
so that we can challenge ourselves.
